# gm/ID Characterization and Design Skill

> **Important — do not modify skill files during normal use.**
> All code edits, new scripts, plots, and simulation outputs should go into the user's **project working directory** (outside `.claude/`), not into this skill folder. Only modify the skill assets (`assets/`, `SKILL.md`, `references/`) when the user explicitly asks to improve or extend the skill itself.

**Dependencies by route**: the built-in PTM and explicitly ngspice-compatible
foundry routes use the `ngspice` skill. An installed foundry PDK supported by
Cadence Spectre uses the `spectre` skill. The independent Windows `ltspice`
skill can generate normalized PTM gm/ID tables for import into this workflow.

## Workflow Routing

- For the built-in PTM 180/45/22 nm models or a standalone SPICE `.lib`, use
  Workflow 1 below.
- For LTspice batch simulation of the same bundled PTM nodes, use the
  `ltspice` skill, then consume its normalized table here for plotting or
  sizing; keep LTspice RAW parsing out of this ngspice engine.
- For an installed foundry PDK that explicitly provides ngspice-compatible
  models, keep the model in place and characterize the wrapper's internal
  compact device. For multi-dimensional tables or an interactive explorer,
  read [references/multidimensional-characterization.md](references/multidimensional-characterization.md).
- For a user-authorized installed foundry PDK with Spectre, use the `spectre`
  skill for model/corner discovery, simulation, and PSF extraction, then return
  the normalized device table to this skill for gm/ID plots and sizing.
- For sizing from an existing characterization table, use Workflow 2.

Built-in models are from [PTM — Arizona State University (ptm.asu.edu)](https://ptm.asu.edu), free for academic research. When citing, use: W. Zhao and Y. Cao, "New Generation of Predictive Technology Model for Sub-45 nm Early Design Exploration," *IEEE Trans. Electron Devices*, vol. 53, no. 11, pp. 2816–2823, Nov. 2006. doi: 10.1109/TED.2006.884077. For nodes beyond the three built-in ones, install the `transistor-models` skill (full PTM library, requires manual MODEL_INFO configuration) or download from [mec.umn.edu/ptm](https://mec.umn.edu/ptm) and copy the `.lib` file into the project's `models/` directory.

---

## Workflow 1: Characterization (Simulation + Plotting)

### Deployment

1. Copy all assets (including the `models/` subdirectory) to `<project>/`
2. Create empty directories `plots/` and `logs/`
3. Run `python run_gmoverid.py` (180 nm) or `python run_multinode.py` (HP multi-node)

For additional nodes, simply copy the extra `.lib` file into `<project>/models/`.

All paths resolve automatically via `Path(__file__).resolve().parent` — no path configuration needed.

### Three Standard Plot Sets (per model)

| Set | Function | Output file |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| Gate capacitance | `plot_caps()` | `gmoverid_caps_{model}_L{node}nm.png` |
| gm/ID four-quadrant | `plot_main()` | `gmoverid_{model}_L{node}nm.png` |
| IV characteristics | `plot_iv()` | `gmoverid_iv_{model}_L{node}nm.png` |

**gm/ID four-quadrant layout (`plot_main`, 2×2):**
```
(0,0) gm/Id [V⁻¹] vs Vov     | (0,1) Id/W [uA/um] vs gm/Id  (log Y)
(1,0) fT [GHz]    vs gm/Id   | (1,1) gm·ro        vs gm/Id
```
- All four panels use Vds as the curve parameter (VDS_LIST)
- gm/Id X-axis: xlim = [4, 24], one grid division per 2 V⁻¹
- Panels (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) apply `_fall_mask(gmid)` before plotting — the gm/ID array is double-valued (same gm/ID appears on the subthreshold rising side and the inversion falling side); only the falling (inversion) side is kept to prevent curve fold-back. Panel (0,0) is exempt because its X-axis is Vov, which is monotonic.

### Adding a New Technology Node

1. Copy the model `.lib` into `models/` (download from [mec.umn.edu/ptm](https://mec.umn.edu/ptm) or install the `transistor-models` skill)
2. Add an entry to `MODEL_INFO` in `simulate_gmoverid.py` (see conventions.md §3)
3. Add an entry to `NODE_CFG` in `run_multinode.py`

This three-step route is for standalone SPICE model cards. For an installed
foundry PDK, do not flatten or copy its models. Use either its explicitly
supported ngspice route or the Spectre workflow linked under Workflow Routing.

### Installed ngspice-compatible foundry PDKs

Treat the PDK as an external, versioned dependency: record its version, include
its library in place, and never copy or rewrite model cards into the project.
Foundry devices may be subcircuit wrappers, so extract `gm`, `gds`, charge
capacitances, threshold, and saturation voltage from the internal compact-model
instance rather than assuming `@xwrapper[param]` exists.

For a reusable design database:

- keep the raw VGS sweep table as the source of truth;
- separate the nominal `L × VDS × VBS` design sweep from the nominal-geometry
  `corner × temperature` sweep unless a full Cartesian database is requested;
- use only the post-peak inversion branch when gm/ID is the lookup axis and do
  not extrapolate unavailable targets;
- emit explicit metadata, units, condition/profile columns, and availability;
- retain static plots for reports, and add a static interactive explorer when
  users need repeated filtering, comparison, and operating-point inspection.

The full schema, interpolation rules, interactive presentation contract, and
acceptance checks are maintained in
[references/multidimensional-characterization.md](references/multidimensional-characterization.md).

## Plotting Conventions (required when creating new figures)

> When generating figures for a new project or plotting for a design report, follow the style of the existing figures produced by this skill.

**Format requirements:**
- Never call `plt.show()`; always use `fig.savefig(path, dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')` and save to `plots/`
- Colors and line styles: cycle through `COLORS`/`LSTYLE` from `plot_gmoverid.py` in order (blue solid, orange dashed, green dash-dot, purple dotted)
- X-axis for gm/ID: always `xlim = [4, 24]` with one tick per 2 V⁻¹; Y-axis `ylim(bottom=0)`
- **Fold-back prevention**: whenever gm/ID is the X-axis, prepend `_fall_mask(gmid)` to the boolean mask. The gm/ID vs Vgs curve peaks and then descends — both sides can fall within [4, 24], causing matplotlib to draw a fold-back. `_fall_mask` discards the subthreshold rising side (before the peak); only the inversion falling side is plotted. This rule applies to `plot_main` panels (0,1)/(1,0)/(1,1) and to the equivalent panels in `plot_comparison`.
- Titles and axis labels: use **ASCII + LaTeX** (e.g. `$g_m/I_D$`); **do not write Chinese characters directly in matplotlib labels**
- **`µ` (U+00B5) fails to render in some terminals and fonts** — always use `u` in axis labels (e.g. `uA/um`, `W=10um`) or LaTeX `$\\mu$`; use Unicode µ only when the user explicitly requests it

**Chinese font warning:**
matplotlib does not include Chinese fonts by default; Chinese characters render as boxes (□□). If Chinese is needed, add at the top of the script:
```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['Microsoft YaHei', 'SimHei', 'DejaVu Sans']
matplotlib.rcParams['axes.unicode_minus'] = False
```
On Windows prefer `Microsoft YaHei`; on Linux/macOS verify the font is installed, otherwise boxes still appear. **The most robust approach is to use only ASCII/LaTeX labels and avoid font dependencies entirely.**

## Workflow 2: Design (Lookup-Table Sizing)

### Core Idea of the gm/ID Methodology

**gm/ID (transconductance efficiency) is the pivot quantity linking circuit specifications to device dimensions.**

Traditional design relies on long-channel model equations (gm = 2Id/Vov) to compute device sizes; errors are severe in advanced nodes (≤ 180 nm). The gm/ID method abandons equations in favor of simulation-generated design charts (lookup tables), using gm/ID as the single independent variable to express all key device performance parameters:

```
gm/ID  ──►  Id/W   (current-density curve → determines W)
       ──►  fT     (transit frequency → determines speed)
       ──►  gm·ro  (intrinsic gain → determines gain ceiling)
       ──►  Vgs    (uniquely determines the bias point)
```

All four curves are **independent of transistor width W** — devices of different W share exactly the same Id/W, fT, and gm·ro values at the same gm/ID point. This is the foundation of the methodology: the design chart needs to be generated only once (at unit width), and it applies directly to any W.

**gm/ID is the trade-off axis for three design objectives:**

| Design priority | Direction of gm/ID | Reason |
|----------------|:-----------------:|--------|
| High speed (fT↑) | Low gm/ID (strong inversion) | High Vov → fast |
| High gain (gm·ro↑) | High gm/ID (weak/moderate inversion) | Closer to subthreshold |
| Low power (Id↓, same W) | High gm/ID | Id/W decreases as gm/ID increases |
| Minimum area (W↓, same Id) | Low gm/ID | Id/W decreases as gm/ID increases |

> Note: area and power optimization point in opposite directions — this is the central trade-off in gm/ID design.

---

### Design Flow (Five Steps)

```
① Choose topology → ② Set L → ③ Choose gm/ID → ④ Derive gm / Id → ⑤ Look up Id/W → get W
```

**① Choose topology**
Select the circuit structure (common-source, differential pair, cascode, common-gate, etc.) based on gain, bandwidth, and swing requirements.

**② Set channel length L**
- Need high speed (high fT) → choose minimum L
- Need high gain (high gm·ro) → increase L moderately (each doubling of L raises gm·ro by roughly 2–4×, with a corresponding fT reduction)
- Verify feasibility first: `tbl.lookup('gmro', gmid_target)` to check the upper bound; if unsatisfied, increase L before considering cascode or multi-stage topologies
- With a PMOS load, also verify PMOS ro: effective gain = gm_n × (ro_n ∥ ro_p)

**③ Choose gm/ID**
Select the trade-off point on the fT–gm/ID and gm·ro–gm/ID curves based on the design priority:
```python
tbl = GmIdTable('nmos45hp', W=1.0, L=0.045, vds=0.5)

# Check boundary values before deciding
print(f"fT   @ gmid=6  : {tbl.lookup('ft',   6.0)/1e9:.1f} GHz")
print(f"fT   @ gmid=15 : {tbl.lookup('ft',  15.0)/1e9:.1f} GHz")
print(f"gmro @ gmid=6  : {tbl.lookup('gmro',  6.0):.1f}")
print(f"gmro @ gmid=15 : {tbl.lookup('gmro', 15.0):.1f}")
```

**④ Derive the required gm from circuit specs, then compute Id**
```python
# Example: BW and gain constraints → gm (ro-aware, see design example section)
Rout = 1 / (2 * 3.14159 * BW * CL)   # RL∥ro, set by bandwidth
gm   = Av / Rout                       # set by gain
Id   = gm / gmid                       # set by gm/ID
```

**⑤ Look up Id/W to get W, round to 100 nm grid**
```python
id_w    = tbl.lookup('id_w', gmid)              # uA/um (W-independent)
W_exact = Id / (id_w * 1e-6)                   # um
W       = round(W_exact / 0.1) * 0.1           # round to 100 nm
# W     = math.ceil(W_exact / 0.1) * 0.1       # or round up (conservative margin)
```

After rounding, recompute Id = W × id_w and verify Av and BW; a ΔW < 5% deviation is usually negligible.

---

### API Reference: `GmIdTable`

```python
from design_gmoverid import GmIdTable, print_op

# First call: runs ngspice automatically and caches to logs/cache/ (JSON)
# Subsequent calls: reads from cache, ~0.05 s
tbl = GmIdTable('nmos180', W=10.0, L=0.18, vds=0.9)
```

**Constructor parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | str | — | Key in `MODEL_INFO`, e.g. `'nmos180'`, `'pmos45hp'` |
| `W` | float | — | Simulation reference width [um] (results are W-independent; any value works) |
| `L` | float | — | Channel length [um] |
| `vds` | float | VDD/2 | Fixed Vds (NMOS) or \|Vsd\| (PMOS) during Vgs sweep [V] |
| `force_resim` | bool | False | If `True`, ignores cache and re-runs simulation |

**Single-quantity lookup (W-independent, depends only on gm/ID):**

```python
tbl.lookup('id_w', gmid)   # Id/W [uA/um]  <- use this to compute W
tbl.lookup('ft',   gmid)   # transit frequency fT [Hz]
tbl.lookup('gmro', gmid)   # intrinsic gain gm·ro
tbl.lookup('vgs',  gmid)   # Vgs (or |Vsg|) [V]  <- bias point
tbl.lookup('vov',  gmid)   # overdrive voltage Vov [V]
tbl.lookup('gm',   gmid)   # transconductance [S] (at reference width W)
```

**Sizing: fix gm/ID + one constraint**

```python
op = tbl.size(gmid=15.0, Id=100e-6)   # given Id, solve for W
op = tbl.size(gmid=15.0, W=20.0)      # given W, solve for Id
op = tbl.size(gmid=15.0, gm=1.5e-3)   # given gm, solve for Id and W
print_op(op)
```

**Constrained sizing: auto-search (highest gm/ID = lowest current)**

```python
op = tbl.size_from_ft(8e9,  W=20.0)    # fT >= 8 GHz, fixed W
op = tbl.size_from_gmro(35, Id=50e-6)  # gm·ro >= 35, fixed Id
```

- `size_from_ft`: suited for known-width, speed-constrained scenarios (LNA transconductor, OTA GBW)
- `size_from_gmro`: suited for high-gain stages (prefer fixing W to avoid excessively large W in weak inversion)

**Keys returned by `size()`:**
```
model, L_um, W_um, Id_A, Vgs_V, Vov_V, gmid, gm_S, ft_Hz, gmro, id_w_Apm
```

### Typical gm/ID Design Parameters by Node

**nmos180 (Vds = 0.9 V, L = 180 nm)**

| gm/ID [V⁻¹] | Id/W [uA/um] | fT [GHz] | gm·ro | Typical use |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------:|:-----:|-------------|
|  5–8  | 42–81 | 20–25 | 27–36 | High-speed circuits, sampling switches |
| 10–12 | 20–29 | 15–18 | 39    | OTA output stage, drivers |
| 13–16 | 8–17  |  9–13 | 39–46 | OTA input differential pair (balanced) |
| 18–20 |  3–6  |  4–6  | 53    | Low-power analog, voltage references |

**nmos45hp / nmos22hp (HP, minimum L)**

| Node | gm/ID [V⁻¹] | Id/W [uA/um] | fT [GHz] | gm·ro | Notes |
|------|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------:|:-----:|-------|
| 45 nm HP | 6–10 | 150–300 | 200–400 | 6–8 | Strong CLM, low gain — ro must be considered |
| 22 nm HP | 6–10 | 200–500 | 400–700 | 3–4 | Very strong DIBL, extremely low gain |

> Vds has a minor effect on Id/W (advanced nodes have lower output impedance): ignore it during initial design, then fine-tune after simulation.

---

## Design Example: 45 nm HP Common-Source Amplifier

**Specifications** (from textbook §5.2.1, 40 nm process, using PTM 45 nm HP as surrogate model):

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| VDD | 1.1 V |
| Low-frequency voltage gain Av | 2 (linear, i.e. 6 dB) |
| −3 dB bandwidth BW | 100 MHz |
| Load capacitance CL | 10 pF |
| Total current Id | ≤ 2 mA |
| Channel length L | 45 nm (minimum gate length) |
| Design target | gm/ID = 10 V⁻¹ (balanced speed vs. power) |

### 1. Derive Design Constraints (ro-aware)

The gain equation includes the ro term and cannot be neglected:

```
|A_DC| = gm·(RL ∥ ro)

1/|A_DC| = 1/(gm·RL) + 1/(gm·ro)

=> gm·RL = 1 / (1/Av − 1/(gm·ro))
```

For 45 nm HP, intrinsic gain gm·ro ≈ 7 (confirmed via `tbl.lookup('gmro', gmid)`). Substituting:

```
gm·RL = 1 / (1/2 − 1/7) ≈ 2.80
```

Bandwidth determines the total output-node impedance (RL ∥ ro), i.e. the actual Rout:

```
Rout = RL ∥ ro = 1 / (2pi × BW × CL)
     = 1 / (2pi × 100 MHz × 10 pF) ≈ 159 Ohm

gm = Av / Rout = 2 / 159 ≈ 12.6 mA/V

RL = gm·RL / gm = 2.80 / 12.6 mS ≈ 222 Ohm
```

> **Why not simply set RL = Rout?** Rout = 159 Ω is RL∥ro, not RL itself. RL must be larger than Rout and is back-calculated from the gain equation using the gm·ro term.

### 2. Size with GmIdTable

```python
from design_gmoverid import GmIdTable
import math

VDD = 1.1;  Av = 2.0;  BW = 100e6;  CL = 10e-12

tbl = GmIdTable('nmos45hp', W=1.0, L=0.045, vds=0.5)

gmid = 10.0
gmro = tbl.lookup('gmro', gmid)   # => 7.11
id_w = tbl.lookup('id_w', gmid)   # => 155.4 uA/um
vgs  = tbl.lookup('vgs',  gmid)   # => 0.499 V  (bias Vgs)
vov  = tbl.lookup('vov',  gmid)   # => 0.244 V

# Step 1: derive gm and RL (ro-aware)
Rout   = 1 / (2 * 3.14159 * BW * CL)   # 159 Ohm = RL||ro
gm_RL  = 1 / (1/Av - 1/gmro)           # 2.80 (gain constraint including ro)
gm     = Av / Rout                      # 12.6 mA/V
RL     = gm_RL / gm                     # 222 Ohm

# Step 2: compute Id and W
Id      = gm / gmid                     # 1.26 mA
W_exact = Id / (id_w * 1e-6)           # 8.09 um
W       = round(W_exact / 0.1) * 0.1   # => 8.1 um (100 nm grid)

# Step 3: verify with rounded W
Id_r  = W * id_w * 1e-6                # 1.259 mA
gm_r  = Id_r * gmid                    # 12.59 mA/V
ro_r  = gmro / gm_r                    # 565 Ohm
Av_r  = gm_r * (RL * ro_r / (RL + ro_r))  # 2.00 ✓
Vd_DC = VDD - Id_r * RL                # 0.821 V  (margin 577 mV >> Vov 244 mV ✓)
```

### 3. Design Summary

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| gm/ID | 10 V⁻¹ |
| **W / L** | **8.1 um / 45 nm** |
| Id | 1.26 mA (< 2 mA ✓) |
| gm | 12.6 mA/V |
| gm·ro | 7.11 |
| RL | 222 Ohm |
| Av (verified) | 2.00 ✓ |
| Vgs (bias) | 0.499 V |
| Vd_DC | 0.821 V |

### 4. Post-Design Simulation (hand off to ngspice skill)

With W, RL, and Vgs in hand, use the `ngspice` skill to build a `.control` block netlist and simulate:

- **DC operating point**: verify `@m1[id]`, `@m1[gm]`, `@m1[gds]` against design values
- **AC frequency response**: `ac dec 200 1e5 1e10` → read `vdb(vout)` → verify low-frequency gain and −3 dB frequency
- **Plotting**: save frequency-gain data with `wrdata`, plot a Bode magnitude response using matplotlib

---

## Self-Validation

Two complementary checks — run both after generating characterization plots.

### Step 1 — Numerical self-check

```bash
python validate_gmoverid.py [model] [L_um]
python validate_gmoverid.py                    # nmos180 @ 180 nm
python validate_gmoverid.py nmos45hp 0.045
```

Five scalar tests, each prints PASS / FAIL:

| # | Test | Pass criterion | Failure meaning |
|---|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Weak-inversion limit | peak gm/ID in [25, 32] V^-1 | gm extraction error near Id ≈ 0 |
| 2 | ID/W monotonicity | zero non-monotone steps | Interpolation oscillation in gm or Id |
| 3a | L-doubling gain | gmro(2L)/gmro(L) ≥ 1.5 | Model ignores CLM |
| 3b | L-doubling fT | fT(2L)/fT(L) in [0.15, 0.70] | Cgg scaling wrong |
| 4 | fT×gm/ID peak | peak at gm/ID in [8, 18] V^-1 | Cgg or gm mismatch |
| 5 | Vds sensitivity | gmro change ≥ 8% across 0.25–0.75 VDD | Model ignores channel-length modulation |

For physics derivation and failure diagnosis see `references/validation.md`.

### Step 2 — Visual inspection by LLM

Generate the four-quadrant plot, then show it to Claude and ask for a
physics assessment.  The expected trends for each panel are listed below —
use them as the inspection checklist.

**Panel (0,0) — gm/ID vs Vov**

| Zone | Expected trend | Typical values |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Vov < 0 (subthreshold) | gm/ID approaches a constant ceiling from below | 25–32 V^-1 (= 1/(n·Ut), n=1.2–1.5) |
| Vov ≈ 0 (threshold) | smooth peak, then monotone descent | peak ≈ 25–32 V^-1 |
| Vov > 0 (strong inversion) | follows 2/Vov (dashed reference line) closely | drops to ~5 V^-1 at Vov=0.4V |

Red flags: peak > 35 (gm noise at low Id), plateau that never decays
(missing strong-inversion region), kink at Vov=0 (Vth extraction error).

Note: for HP minimum-L nodes, DIBL raises the slope factor n toward 1.4–1.5,
so the subthreshold ceiling legitimately sits closer to 25 V^-1 rather than
32 V^-1 — this is correct, not a model defect.

**Panel (0,1) — Id/W vs gm/ID (log Y)**

| Feature | Expected |
|---------|---------|
| Direction | strictly decreasing left to right (strong→weak inversion) |
| Shape on log scale | approximately linear (exponential decay in weak inversion) |
| Range | spans ≥ 2 decades across gm/ID = [4, 24] |
| Multiple Vds curves | nearly overlapping (Id/W is weakly Vds-dependent in saturation) |

Red flags: any upward hook (fold-back from subthreshold rising side —
fixed by `_fall_mask`), flat segment (resolution too coarse), curves
widely separated by Vds (device not in saturation).

**Panel (1,0) — fT vs gm/ID**

| Feature | Expected |
|---------|---------|
| Direction | monotonically decreasing left to right |
| Shape | roughly follows a power law; steeper decay toward high gm/ID |
| Magnitude | 180nm: 5–30 GHz; 45nm HP: 100–400 GHz |
| Multiple Vds curves | nearly overlapping (fT is Vds-insensitive in saturation) |

Red flags: fT increases with gm/ID (sign inversion in gm or Cgg),
non-monotone wiggles (ngspice convergence issue near threshold), fT > 1 THz
or < 1 GHz at reasonable bias (Cgg extraction error).

**Panel (1,1) — gm·ro vs gm/ID**

| Feature | Expected |
|---------|---------|
| Direction | generally increasing left to right (weak inversion has higher gain) |
| Magnitude | 180nm: 20–60; 45nm HP min-L: 5–15 |
| Vds dependence | curves separated — higher Vds → lower gmro (stronger CLM) |
| Shape | smooth, no kinks; may plateau in strong inversion |

Red flags: completely flat across all gm/ID (CLM ignored), gmro > 200 at
moderate gm/ID for short-channel nodes (gds underestimated), kinks at
specific Vgs points (sparse Vds-sweep interpolation artefact — use
`vgs_gds_results` to enable finite-difference gds path).

### Interpreting LLM visual feedback

LLM image analysis is powerful for shape and smoothness but requires
physical context to interpret correctly:

- **"Peak below BJT limit 38.6 V^-1"** — expected; MOSFETs have n > 1.
  Correct ceiling is 1/(n·Ut) ≈ 25–32 V^-1.
- **"Curves widely separated in panel (0,1) or (1,0)"** — check Vds values;
  if all are well into saturation the separation should be < 20%.
- **"gmro is very low (5–10)"** — normal for HP minimum-L nodes; not a defect.
- **"Curve does not reach weak inversion"** — increase Vgs sweep range or
  lower id_thresh in `sweep_vgs`.

## Reference Documents

See `references/conventions.md` for full details:
- §1–5  Project structure, symbol conventions, MODEL_INFO, netlist templates, data-dict keys
- §6–7  Sweep configuration constants (NODE_CFG), plotting conventions and figure list
- §8–9  Physical sanity-check values, common errors and fixes
- §10   Extending the skill (new nodes, new plot types, new channel lengths)
- §11   Full design API reference (GmIdTable, print_op, cache naming, unit conventions)

For an installed proprietary PDK, use the `spectre` skill for simulator and
PDK mechanics. Keep this skill responsible for normalized gm/ID quantities,
plots, validation, lookup, and transistor sizing.
