Six skill packages for analog simulation and its supporting workflows: **ngspice basics** / **Cadence Spectre workflow** / **gm/ID design** / **PTM model library** / **Sky130A PDK workflow** / **authorized SSH text deployment**.

## Skill 1: ngspice

9 simulation examples covering the core concepts of introductory analog circuits:

| # | Type | Description | Output |
|---|------|------|------|
| 1 | Tran | RC charging voltage and current | `tran_rc_charging.png` |
| 2 | DC | NMOS Id-Vds family of curves | `dc_nmos_iv.png` |
| 3 | AC | RC low-pass filter frequency response | `ac_rc_bw.png` |
| 4 | Noise | RC filter output noise spectral density | `ac_rc_bw.png` |
| 5 | Tran | Sample-and-hold switch comparison | `sample_hold_compare.png` |
| 6 | Tran | kT/C noise time-domain statistics | `tran_ktc_noise_hist.png` |
| 7 | DC | NMOS current mirror output characteristics | `dc_current_mirror.png` |
| 8 | AC | Common-source amplifier Bode plot | `ac_cs_amp_bode.png` |
| 9 | DC | Transmission-gate on-resistance | `dc_tgate_ron.png` |

See [`ngspice/SKILL.md`](./ngspice/SKILL.md) for usage. The Agent will automatically deploy the assets and run the examples.

## Skill 2: spectre

The Spectre skill covers Cadence Spectre as a simulator rather than binding to
one process. It provides native netlist and CLI patterns, safe discovery of an
installed foundry PDK's active model section, direct device operating-point
output, PSFASCII-to-CSV conversion, and licensed remote-server troubleshooting.

It does not include Cadence binaries or proprietary PDK files. Process-specific
paths, corners, and device names remain in the user's project. The verified
TSMC40 gm/ID example is under `practice/tsmc40_spectre/`.

See [`spectre/SKILL.md`](./spectre/SKILL.md) for usage.

## Skill 3: gmoverid

Each process node generates three sets of standard plots:

**IV Characteristic Plot** (2x2)
- Id vs Vov in linear scale: clearly shows the threshold and saturation current
- Id vs Vov in log scale: subthreshold slope and an approximately 7-decade dynamic range
- Id vs Vgs (full sweep from 0 to VDD)
- Output characteristics, Id vs Vds (multiple curves at fixed Vgs values)

![IV characteristic plot](gmoverid_iv_nmos45hp_L45nm.png)

**gm/ID Four-Quadrant Characteristic Plot** (2x2)
- **gm/ID vs Vov**: full weak-inversion to strong-inversion behavior, including the BJT limit q/kT = 38.6 V^-1 and the 2/Vov asymptote reference
- **Id/W vs gm/ID** (log Y-axis): current density as the bias point changes, spanning approximately 3 decades
- **fT vs gm/ID**: cutoff frequency; PTM 180nm peaks at about 50 GHz, while PTM 22nm HP exceeds 600 GHz
- **gm*ro vs gm/ID**: intrinsic gain distribution versus bias point; 180nm reaches about 40-42 in weak inversion (gm/ID ~= 20), while 22nm HP is only 2-4 because of significant short-channel effects

![gm/ID four-quadrant characteristic plot](gmoverid_nmos45hp_L45nm.png)

**Gate Capacitance Plot**
- Cgg / Cgs / Cgd / Cgb vs Vgs: shows capacitance distribution and transitions from cutoff to threshold to strong inversion

**Comparison Plots**
- Channel-length comparison (L = 180 / 360 / 1000 nm): longer channels significantly improve gm*ro (up to ~140), with a corresponding reduction in fT
- Cross-node comparison (180nm SVT vs 22nm HP): clearly shows the speed-gain tradeoff across technology generations

![Gate capacitance plot](gmid_nmos_caps_comp.png)

**Design API**: given a gm/ID target, automatically looks up W, Id, Vgs, gm, fT, and gm*ro

```python
from design_gmoverid import GmIdTable, print_op

tbl = GmIdTable('nmos180', W=10.0, L=0.18, vds=0.9)

op = tbl.size(gmid=15.0, Id=100e-6)   # Fixed gm/ID and drain current; solve for W
op = tbl.size_from_ft(5e9, W=20.0)    # fT >= 5 GHz; choose the lowest-power operating point
print_op(op)
```

The first call automatically runs the ngspice simulation and caches the result. Later calls read directly from the cache.

The package includes three built-in PTM models: **180 / 45 / 22 nm**. Once installed, it is ready for simulation. If you need more process nodes, install the `transistor-models` skill.

## Skill 4: transistor-models

PTM (Predictive Technology Model) is a public SPICE model set maintained by Arizona State University (ASU), intended for process exploration and teaching or research when no PDK is available. This skill packages all models from [mec.umn.edu/ptm](https://mec.umn.edu/ptm):

- Traditional bulk silicon: 180 / 130 / 90 / 65 nm
- Bulk silicon HP/LP: 45 / 32 / 22 nm
- PTM-MG FinFET (multi-gate): 20 / 16 / 14 / 10 / 7 nm, HP + LSTP

It is independent of `gmoverid`. `gmoverid` already includes commonly used nodes; install this skill only when you need additional nodes such as 32nm LP or 7nm FinFET.

Copy the required `.lib` files from `transistor-models/assets/models/` into your project's `models/` directory as needed:

```bash
cp transistor-models/assets/models/bulk_cmos/ptm32lp.lib <project-dir>/models/
cp transistor-models/assets/models/finfet/nmos7mg_hp.lib <project-dir>/models/
```

File naming rules:
- `bulk_cmos/ptm{node}{hp|lp}.lib` - bulk silicon HP/LP, including NMOS + PMOS (model names: `nmos` / `pmos`)
- `bulk_cmos/ptm{node}.lib` - traditional bulk silicon, including NMOS + PMOS
- `finfet/{n|p}mos{node}mg_{hp|lstp}.lib` - FinFET (model names: `nfet` / `pfet`)

For the detailed parameter table, see [`transistor-models/references/model_params.md`](./transistor-models/references/model_params.md).

## Skill 5: sky130-pdk

Sky130A is a real open PDK workflow, not a PTM model file. This skill does not vendor the PDK payload; it teaches the Agent how to install or locate Sky130A with Volare/open_pdks and how to run ngspice PVT + Monte Carlo smoke tests.

Included smoke examples:

- NMOS Id-Vgs across `tt/ff/ss/fs/sf` plus MC current spread.
- Three-stage CMOS ring oscillator frequency across process corners and MC.
- Five-transistor OTA low-frequency gain across process corners and MC.
- Standalone `.scs` and ngspice `.spi` examples for `ring_oscillator`, `ota-5t`, and `amp-2s-miller`, plus a small Sky130 SCS-to-ngspice-Sky130 converter for user circuit netlists.

Typical install:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user volare
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
volare enable --pdk sky130 c6d73a35f524070e85faff4a6a9eef49553ebc2b
```

Run a smoke test from a cloned repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arcadia-1/gmoverid-skill
cd gmoverid-skill/sky130-pdk
python3 assets/run_sky130_mos_iv_pvt_mc.py --mc-runs 3
python3 assets/run_sky130_ringosc_pvt_mc.py --mc-runs 3
python3 assets/run_sky130_five_transistor_ota_pvt_mc.py --mc-runs 3
```

Run a direct ngspice example:

```bash
export PDK_ROOT="$(volare path)/volare/sky130/versions/$(volare output --pdk sky130)"
cd gmoverid-skill/sky130-pdk/examples/ota-5t
ngspice -b tb.spi
```

Typical model entry:

```spice
.lib "$PDK_ROOT/sky130A/libs.tech/combined/continuous/sky130.lib.spice" tt
.lib "$PDK_ROOT/sky130A/libs.tech/combined/continuous/sky130.lib.spice" mc
```

See [`sky130-pdk/SKILL.md`](./sky130-pdk/SKILL.md) for usage.

## Skill 6: ssh-text-deploy

This supporting skill handles a narrow managed-host failure mode: an authorized
UTF-8 source or document is changed or wrapped when uploaded through ordinary
managed file transfer. It provides conservative PowerShell tooling for atomic
SSH-stdin deployment, optional LF normalization, SHA-256 verification, and TSD
header detection.

It is not a general security bypass. It requires authorization for the exact
host/path and a server policy that permits shell-created files; otherwise the
workflow stops and defers to the administrator-approved channel.

See [`ssh-text-deploy/SKILL.md`](./ssh-text-deploy/SKILL.md) for usage.
